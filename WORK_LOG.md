| March 11 |  9 - 9:30pm   |                                                         I brainstormed. I tried creating more methods. I was trying to figure out getRemovals(). |
| March 11 | 9:30 - 10:pm  | I managed to code in a way to return removals. I did this by doing a nested for loop. It returns all the chars in typed that aren't in dictWord. |
