| March 11 | 9:25 - 9:55am |                                                                                      I started adding methods. I tried using abstraction. I created instance variables. |
| March 11 |  9 - 9:30pm   |                                                                                I brainstormed. I tried creating more methods. I was trying to figure out getRemovals(). |
| March 11 | 9:30 - 10:pm  |                        I managed to code in a way to return removals. I did this by doing a nested for loop. It returns all the chars in typed that aren't in dictWord. |
| March 17 |  9 - 9:30 pm  |              I tried debugging. I realized that I had to check whether or not the arraylists in the array were null. I also had to make the table have ints, not chars. |
| March 17 |  9:30 - 10pm  |                                                                                        I debugged some more. I found that all the tests were passing. I wrote comments. |
| March 17 |  10 - 10:30   |                                                                                     I brainstormed. I tried to figure out an algorithm. The algorithm would skip words. |
| March 17 |  10:30 - 11   | The mismatched word could also have the first letter mismatched. It could also be close in edit distance. Skipping based on sorting of dictionary words wasn't working. |
| March 17 |  11 - 11:30   |                                                                                         I tried different functions. These functions could add. They could also delete. |
