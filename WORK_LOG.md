| March 11 | 9:25 - 9:55am |                                                                         I started adding methods. I tried using abstraction. I created instance variables. |

| March 11 | 9:30 - 10:pm  |           I managed to code in a way to return removals. I did this by doing a nested for loop. It returns all the chars in typed that aren't in dictWord. |
| March 17 |  9 - 9:30 pm  | I tried debugging. I realized that I had to check whether or not the arraylists in the array were null. I also had to make the table have ints, not chars. |
